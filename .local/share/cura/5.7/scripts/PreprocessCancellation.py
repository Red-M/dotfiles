# PreprocessCancellation.py - Cura Caller for
#
# Preprocess Cancellation - Klipper GCode Preprocessor for Object Cancellation
#
# This is a small helper script that allows to call the preprocess_cancellation executable by Cura.
# Place it together with the executable in the cura configuration folder:
# Detailed Instructions:
#     Click Help menu item.
#     Click "Show Configuration Folder".
#     Find the folder call "scripts". If you don't see one create one in the configuration folder.
#     Place the python script PreprocessCancellation.py and the preprocess_cancellation executable for your os into the script folder.
#     Restart Cura.
# Now, in Extensions > Post Processing > Modify G-Code select the "Add a script"-button and from the menu that appears choose "Preprocess Cancellation".
# gcode files will be modified by saving. Notice that it can take serval seconds to finish.
